# Font-Awesome-Class-Names
A hacky tool to get the class names from the Font Awesome icon page

This script will grab all of the class names from the Font Awesome icon page. This includes any of the icons used in the page itself, so you need to remove external icons used in navigation etc from the list.

Todo:
- Filter icons so only those listed in the icon list are retrieved
